# Console-Finances

## Description 

This repository was created to return important data from the array Finances using JavaScript. In real life, we often register data and we need to use it to understand where to improve, where the business is strong and how the market usually works. In this practice, we used the array of Finances to simulate the Increase and Decrease in Profit of a business. Using JavaScript for loops, .length, conditionals, comparison and alert I was able to find the requested data and bring to the screen the results. It was a really interesting challenge that allowed me to develop my skills in JavaScript to understand its use more in real life. 

Future features: Interface where the data and the processes can be seen by the user.
